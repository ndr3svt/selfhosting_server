            <p>This looks about right. We are live self-hosting from your home machine!</p>
            <p>Let's turn on the server to see what happens.</p>
            <p>The "something went wrong" message is because locally we are not serving any web app or returning an HTTP response interpreted by the browser as HTML.</p>
            <p>Let's try again.</p>
            <p>Nice! We have our local website being forwarded by our server.</p>
