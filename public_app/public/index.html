        <p>This looks about right. We are live self hosting from your home machine!!!!</p>
        <p> let's turn on the server to see what happens</p>
        <p>The something went wrong message is because locally we are not serving any web app, website or returning an http response that can be interpreted by the browser as an html structure and provide a visual output</p>
        <p>let's try again</p>
        <p>nice we have our local website being forwarded by our server </p>
