# Simple Server to Self-Host Any Domain

## Introduction

This repository presents a methodology for self-hosting a custom domain using a low-cost home infrastructure. It leverages Cloudflare and IPv6 to proxy traffic between your domain's DNS and the IPv6 address of your home machine.

It also demonstrates an example of hosting multiple domains on the same server by routing traffic based on URL patterns to your locally hosted Node.js applications.

This offers a compact and highly cost-effective solution for hosting a wide range of applications, including simple websites, web apps, APIs, SaaS Products, WebSocket managers, database servers, and moreâ€”whatever you need.

This solution is perfect for building and testing your products with close-to-zero costs, even enabling you to serve them to real users and customers. It allows you to validate your business idea before deciding to scale it further.


## Requirements
- You'll need a domain, which you can purchase from any domain registrar. In this example, we use a domain registered through Namecheap.
- You'll also need a spare machine, preferably a headless one to minimize energy consumption. This could be a Raspberry Pi, Mac Mini, or a similar device. Ideally, the machine should run Linux or Unix for smoother installation of npm, Node.js modules, and IPv6-related protocols.
- Lastly, you'll need a free Cloudflare account and a stable internet connection. The faster the connection, the better the performance.
